A project aimed to explain reinforcement learning in the most simplistic way ever possible by training a _32px by 32px_ game of flappy bird using Q-learning through a script written purely in JavaScript.

The script [`js/brain.js`](js/brain.js) is where the learning logic resides and has been documented heavily to explain the baseline Q-learning algorithm from scratch and how it can be applied in a real-time scenario.
