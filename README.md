Flappy Bird using Reinforcement Learning in JS


In the quest to demystify reinforcement learning, this project presents a
groundbreaking approach by training a minimalist version of the iconic Flappy
Bird game using Q-learning, all within the confines of a web browser and pure
JavaScript. The heart of the project lies in its succinctly documented brain.js
script, which meticulously unpacks the fundamental concepts of Q-learning,
making them accessible even to those new to the field. By intuitively
encapsulating the essence of Q-learning, the script transforms the 32px by 32px
Flappy Bird game into a sandbox for learning. With no external dependencies,
users can seamlessly train and test the game directly within their browsers,
experiencing firsthand the principles of reinforcement learning in action.
Remarkably, the project showcases the bird's ability to navigate a static,
unchanging environment after just 25 trials—a testament to the efficiency and
efficacy of Q-learning. However, the journey doesn't stop there. By introducing
randomized environments, the project underscores the adaptability and
resilience of the learning algorithm, demonstrating that while mastery may take
longer—sometimes exceeding 1000 trials—the bird eventually learns to
navigate even the most unpredictable terrains. Through this project, the complex
world of reinforcement learning is distilled into its purest form, empowering
enthusiasts and novices alike to grasp its inner workings. By providing a
tangible, interactive platform for experimentation and learning, it heralds a new
era of accessibility in the realm of artificial intelligence education.
In essence, this project transcends the boundaries of conventional learning,
paving the way for a future where the intricacies of reinforcement learning are
within reach for all who seek to understand them.
